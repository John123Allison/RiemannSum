# RiemannSum
Small program that approximates areas under a curve using Riemann Sums.

**From Wikipedia:** In mathematics, a Riemann sum is a certain kind of approximation of an integral by a finite sum... The sum is calculated by partitioning the region into shapes (rectangles, trapezoids, parabolas, or cubics) that together form a region that is similar to the region being measured, then calculating the area for each of these shapes, and finally adding all of these small areas together.
